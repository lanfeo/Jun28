Currently has 1 asteroid rotating around randomly and a blue ship that can be user controlled to fly around

TODO

1. make the blue ship fly a fixed distance in the direction of the touch event instead of to the destination.

2. rotate the ship to face the direction of the touch event

3. move animation code for asteroids so that we can generate multiple asteroids moving around randomly (and remove limit of having hte asteroid on the screen

4. stop animations if ship collides with asteroids
